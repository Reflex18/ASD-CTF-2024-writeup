### Caution and Directions:
Welcome to the Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) CTF challenge series for the 2024 ASD-ANU CoLab CTF. For this challenge series, you will **not** need to do any of the following:

-   Access any potentially dangerous websites
-   Create an account on any website
-   Browse the dark web

You only need resourceful web searching and free online tools to overcome the challenges of gathering information about a profile marker or 'indicator'. The storyline is entirely fictional, including the subject under investigation, which was chosen randomly for this challenge.

### Plot and First Task:
> Hello Analysts,
>
>There have been some significant movements recently, and your expertise is crucial in handling this urgent task.
>
>Background:
>
>The Dark Web team received an anonymous tip-off from a source called "Reviere", claiming to be involved with the notorious Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) group known as "DEEP RILE". The same group attributed to the development of the "Killer Wasp" ransomware that has impacted over 15-thousand Australians and likely over a hundred thousand individuals worldwide. At the centre of the DEEP RILE RaaS operation is a threat actor known by the pseudonym "FuzzyHash".
>
>We can confirm that the threat actor, FuzzyHash, has been active in DarkWeb hacking forums since at least October of 2021. FuzzyHash primarily advertised its hacking and malware development services for over a year, showcasing its skills and generating a reasonable online reputation. Then, in early 2023, after appearing to remain unaffiliated with any threat group, the DEEP RILE group had their first known mention when FuzzyHash began promoting a RaaS affiliate program for the group, claiming to be involved in the creating, leveraging their online reputation for added publicity. In subsequent activity, FuzzyHash self-identified as the lead developer behind the RaaS operation and the brains behind the Killer Wasp ransomware.
>
>While we do not usually take anonymous tip-offs this seriously, let alone those of the Dark Web, Reviere provided compelling evidence indicating their proximity to and intimate knowledge of the DEEP RILE RaaS group and the development of the Killer Wasp ransomware.
>
>Tasking:
>
>The dark web team's source, Reviere, provided esoteric information about FuzzyHash in their tip-off. Your task is to investigate the indictors of interest and report your findings. Please start with the following domain as your first indicator:
>
>_belowthelinemedia.com_
>
>Report back with any findings.
