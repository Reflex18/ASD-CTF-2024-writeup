# Autonomous - OSINT(a) 2

## Description

Well done on getting us that full URL of the image. Our central ops have given us the next task. We have to figure out which ASN hosts the domain of that website where that image came from.
Flag is of the format ASDCTF{asn} where asn is seven characters long, begins with the string "AS", and finishes with five digits.
