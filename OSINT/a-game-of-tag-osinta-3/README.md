# A game of tag - OSINT(a) 3

## Description

Phew…. Last step in this task. Apparently this website that you’ve been looking at… the one where that original image came from…. It’s linked to the website for the Attorney-General's Department somehow? My boss told me it is important to understand what websites are built with and that there will be a specific Google Analytics Tag linking those sites?
Flag is of the format ASDCTF{tag}, where 'tag' is case sensitive and includes letters, hyphen, and numbers.
