# Cross-number puzzle

## Description

Complete the grid and submit as the flag ASDCTF{numberstring} where numberstring is the concatenation of the numbers in the grid from top left to bottom right. numberstring is 22 characters long.
Clue numbers have been shuffled, but no across clues have ended up as down clues. Nor have down clues ended up under the ACROSS heading.
Note that the numbers used in this challenge are from a constructed language (conlang), not from an actual human language.
Each white cell contains exactly one digit. So, for example, one across (four cells) is a four-digit number, while one down (five cells) is a five-digit number.
Numbers in the grid do not start with zero.
