# Compressed

## Description

Someone has done some things to a message to greatly compress it, to the point where it's almost unreadable. Our experts figured out a few things, but now they're stuck. Perhaps you can help. Here's what they've come up with: 1. It's in a foreign language that uses the Latin script. 2. The letter 'w' usually represents 'au' or 'ua'. 3. The pair of letters 'ng' often gets shortened to just 'g'. 4. Vowels in the middle of a word are mostly removed. Some vowels at the end of some words might have been removed too. 5. There's possibly a sound substition going on with the use of '2'. 6. There was a suggestion about one of the words in the middle looking like it might have come from an English word, but our experts left for lunch before we could get further information. One other thing: As our experts were walking out the door, one of them was heard to say, "That Stefan Trost site might be useful."
