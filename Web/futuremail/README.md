# futuremail

## Description

Sign up to our private mail server at https://futuremail.ctfchallenges.net/ and send an email to flag@futuremail.ctfchallenges.net to get the flag.

I created a script for this one with help from good ol chat gpt.

This script was made in python to modify to headers to appear from the future.

I did have to sign up for the webmail first before being able to send an email over.

flag = ASDCTF{h3ll0 71m3 7r4v3ll3r}
