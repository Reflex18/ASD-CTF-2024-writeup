# Help me Harry

## Description

Dear Harry,
How are you, old chap? I'm doing fine here. So glad that I've had a break from teaching for a few weeks.
Look, there's something that I would like you to help me with. It's a bit awkward, actually. One of my students gave me a puzzle to solve over the holidays and to my shame I haven't been able to crack it. I've spent a few hours on it and made a bit of progress (the textual steganography bit), but I'm stumped as to what to do next.
The student gave me the puzzle in an envelope, which I ignored at first. Eventually I had a close look at the envelope (which smelled vinegary) and it had a few clues written in tiny letters on the back. The first one was the word "bookends", and that obviously relates to the bit that I'd already worked out. The second clue was "Inspired by a cipher from 1905 AD. Sounds like a motor race". The phrase "inspired by" indicates that he has made some modification to an existing system. I can't imagine that it's too great a modification, or the puzzle would become impossible. The final clue was two words: "famous cipher". Well that's just lovely, isn't it. I can think of several ciphers that I would describe as 'famous'. If only he had provided another clue to help me narrow the possibilities down to one cipher. I have a nagging feeling that he did provide such a clue, but I've missed it.
This student is a very logical and methodical youngster, so I think that he has provided one clue for each layer of a three-layer puzzle. In other words, just as the first clue relates only to the steganography layer, the second clue refers to only the second layer and the third clue refers to only the third layer. It's also possible that there is a clue or two inside the text. The word 'square' jumped out at me, but I don't know how that fits in with anything.
Of course, the numbers down the bottom must be absolutely crucial. I'm hoping that you will understand what to do with them.
If you would be so kind as to solve this beast and let me know the solution.
Sincerely,
Reginald
