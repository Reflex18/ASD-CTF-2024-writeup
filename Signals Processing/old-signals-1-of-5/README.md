## Description

An ASD time traveler has gone back in time to collect a range of data format artefacts for the CTF. Our time traveler loves to play historical hide and seek. Weâ€™ve given you the date each artefact was collected. Your challenge is to identify the location that each of these artifacts was gathered from.
